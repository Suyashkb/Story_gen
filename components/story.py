The only illumination came from long fluorescent light panels on the ceiling, which cast an even, shadowless light across the space.
        The floor was polished concrete, and the walls were painted a uniform off-white. Along the length of the room, there were six rows of metal shelving units, bolted to the floor and ceiling. Each unit was six shelves high and divided into sections by thin metal partitions. The shelves were filled with cardboard archive boxes of a standard size and color, a neutral beige. 
        Every box had a white label affixed to its front. On each label, a sequence of alphanumeric characters was printed in black ink, corresponding to a location index in a database. The boxes were aligned flush with the edge of the shelves. A person entered the room, their footsteps making no sound on the concrete floor. 
        They consulted a tablet, then walked to the third aisle, fourth unit, second shelf from the top. They located the box with the label FIN-Q3-2024-B7. Using both hands, they slid the box forward, off the shelf, and placed it onto a rolling metal cart that had been brought in. The box was then wheeled back towards the door. After exiting, the door was closed, and the lock engaged with an audible click, leaving the room in its previous state of order and silence.

A series of monitors were arranged in a semi-circle on a long console. Each monitor displayed a different data feed: flow rates, pH levels, turbidity measurements, and chlorine concentrations. 
        The numbers and graphs updated in real-time, with green figures indicating values within the acceptable range and yellow figures indicating a deviation requiring monitoring. No figures were red. On the main screen, a schematic of the entire plant was displayed.Blue lines showed the path of water moving from the primary intake pumps, through the coagulation and flocculation basins, and into the sedimentation tanks visible through the window. 
        Small icons on the schematic blinked at a regular interval, signifying that each piece of equipment was online and operational. The operator on duty observed the screens, periodically making entries into a digital logbook on a separate computer. The keyboard clicks were the only sharp sounds in the room. Outside, the water in the large concrete tanks was still and grey. 
        A mechanical scraper arm, extending across the width of a tank, moved very slowly from one end to the other. Its function was to collect settled solids from the bottom of the tank and move them towards a collection hopper. The arm‚Äôs progress was almost imperceptible unless one focused on its position relative to a fixed point on the tank‚Äôs edge.

            And we don‚Äôt have to. Not alone.
            In the weeks that followed, Priya began creating small spaces for others to feel less alone, too: She started a ‚ÄúSetback Saturdays‚Äù thread in her office Slack- a space where teammates could casually share one thing that hadn‚Äôt gone well that week, paired with one thing they were still proud of.
            During chai breaks, instead of jumping to pep-talks, she‚Äôd ask gently: ‚ÄúWant to vent or want company?‚Äù
            Just holding space became her quiet offering. On Instagram, she began posting small, honest reflections. Not curated wins, just real moments. A line from her journal. A half-burnt toast. A caption that simply read: ‚ÄúLearning as I go.‚Äù
            And when friends spiraled after rejections, she didn‚Äôt give advice first. She shared her own story. Not to compare, but to connect.

            Because Priya knew now: sometimes, healing begins not with solutions, but with someone saying, ‚ÄúMe too. I get it.‚Äù
            And in choosing to be that someone ‚Äî she helped others remember they were never alone to begin with.
