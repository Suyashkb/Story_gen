She stared at her reflection with disgust; the acne scars she couldn’t hide, the dark circles under her eyes from another night of cramming, and worst of all, the memory of how she’d snapped at her chemistry teacher.

            “You’re such a mess,” she whispered. “No wonder people lose patience with you. You can’t even control your tone.”

            Ananya shook her head. She didn’t deserve the comfort. She barely managed a grunt and turned away.
            Later that evening, Maya wrote something on their shared whiteboard before heading out:
            “Be as kind to yourself as you are to me when I break down.”
            Ananya read it and scoffed. “Kindness to myself? For what?” she muttered. “I haven’t done a single thing right this week.”

Her shoulders tensed. She didn’t offer herself compassion. Not even neutrality. Just a brutal inventory of everything wrong.But she paused, just for a moment. Not because she felt better, but because she was too exhausted to continue hating herself.
            It wasn’t healing. It wasn’t growing. Just a pause. A breath before the next wave. But even that breath was something.

            The old Tanya might’ve buried herself under a blanket, numbing the ache with endless anime edits. But today, she wrapped herself in softness. She made warm soup, rewatched a Shah Rukh Khan classic, and whispered kindly to herself,

Take a breath. You’re more than this moment.” She began doodling little kindness reminders on the corners of her old notebooks — “Be gentle with your pace,” or “Pause before you punish yourself” and left them on the library table for others to find.In her entrance exam group chat, whenever stress spiraled, she’d drop a note: “If you spoke to a friend the way you speak to yourself, would they feel safe? Be that friend to you.” And once a week, she started posting simple, honest reflections on her Instagram story: a photo of her mandala, a line from her journal, or just, “Today was hard. I was kind to myself anyway.”

Everyone was carrying something. Everyone was trying. The world wasn’t about flawless wins — it was about showing up anyway.
That night, she journaled: “Today, I felt left out. But I also took care of myself. And I saw others doing the same.”
She didn’t pretend everything was fine. But she didn’t feel alone in her sadness either.
Her heart had grown quiet — not because it stopped aching, but because it understood: no one walks through this life unscathed.
And we don’t have to. Not alone.
In the weeks that followed, Priya began creating small spaces for others to feel less alone, too: She started a “Setback Saturdays” thread in her office Slack- a space where teammates could casually share one thing that hadn’t gone well that week, paired with one thing they were still proud of.
During chai breaks, instead of jumping to pep-talks, she’d ask gently: “Want to vent or want company?”

Just holding space became her quiet offering. On Instagram, she began posting small, honest reflections. Not curated wins, just real moments. A line from her journal. A half-burnt toast. A caption that simply read: “Learning as I go.”

Because Priya knew now: sometimes, healing begins not with solutions, but with someone saying, “Me too. I get it.”

    #     Later that week, when a friend in her art group confessed to feeling “useless” after a competition loss, Sana listened without interrupting. Then she shared her own story  not to fix, but to reflect.

        Arav was practicing a complex sitar composition in his music class at Shantiniketan. He’d spent two weeks refining every note, coaxing the melody into shape, letting his fingers memorize the rhythm like breath.
        On the final day, just as the raag reached its peak, his fingers faltered. A jarring note rang out; sharp, misplaced and broke the silence.
        The room went still.
        P2
        Arav paused, then smiled gently.
        “Well… that note had its own idea,” he said, shrugging.
        His teacher tilted her head. “Not frustrated?”
        “I felt it,” he replied, tuning the string again, “but I’ve learned not to let a wrong note write the whole song.”
        As he walked back through the tree-lined campus, the scent of blooming champa flowers in the air, Arav felt calm. Years ago, a mistake like this would have shaken him — he’d have replayed it all evening, questioned his talent, skipped dinner.
        But now, he knew better. He could feel disappointment and still continue. Like a passing breeze, not a permanent storm. The note had slipped;  not his worth.
        He smiled inwardly. In life, some moments fall out of tune. That doesn’t mean we’re out of tune.
        P3
        Later that week, during a casual jam session, he heard a classmate groan after a missed note. Arav sat beside him and said, “You know, even seasoned artists miss beats. But they won't stop playing.”
        He began sharing small reminders with his peers:A playlist of live performances with visible imperfections.A journal corner in the practice room: “Write one kind thing to yourself after each session.”Group pauses before practice: two minutes of breath and silence, just to arrive.
        Sometimes, he'd gently remind them, “You’re not perfect. You’re the one showing up with the courage to try again.” And slowly, like the soft return of a familiar raag, acceptance began to hum through the group.

        Other than the main character, use the name of the provided first person they reach out to in their difficult times and refer to all more characters in third person (do not specify more names).
        try to subtly integrate the following context about the character's state of mind and background, these are the responses to their question :
        - Is there anything on your mind right now ? '{_pdata['emotion']}'
        - Perspective on family expectations: '{_pdata['family_oriented']}'

        The theme for this specific scene is: **{theme_name}**

        1. The base template is currenlty divided into 3 parts in which first paragraph is for context building, second has a lot of emphasis on the monologues and third paragraph has conclusion. Generate the new stories with similar structure split into 3 paragraphs.
        2.  Personalize the theme for the character.
        3.  Keep the tone grounded and subtle, with Indian college-life cues if appropriate.
        4.  Use simple, accessible language.
        5.  The output must be 3 short paragraphs.
        6.  Do not repeat the base template or the ongoing story verbatim. Adapt and evolve the narrative.
        7.  The response must be **only the raw story text**. Do not include any titles, headings, or introductions like "Here is the scene...".
        8.  Try to include monologues or internal dialogues that reflect the character's emotional state and growth.
        9.  Use the vocabulary of a middle school child (easy to understand and simple words)

        3.  **Subtlety is Key:** The change should feel natural and earned, not sudden or preachy. It's an internal shift.
        4.  **Tone:** Maintain the grounded, realistic tone of the story.
        5.  **Format:** The output must be similar to the original scene- short paragraphs of **raw story text only**. No titles, headings, or explanations.

Fluorescent lights overhead provided even illumination without shadows. A digital clock above the doorway read 11:42 AM. Near the corner of the room, a large multifunction printer sat beside a recycling bin filled with discarded paper. 
        Its display screen showed a ready status. A person approached, inserted a badge into the reader, and selected a document from the queue. The machine started printing with a mechanical rhythm. Sheets of paper slid out one by one and settled on the output tray. 
        The person stood still, looking out the window while waiting. Outside, a construction crane moved slowly in the distance, rotating without sound through the sealed glass. Once the last page was printed, the person gathered the papers, aligned the stack, and returned to their desk.No one else spoke, and the room remained still apart from the distant tapping of keyboards. A wall calendar displayed the current month with no markings or annotations.

Rows of fluorescent lights stretched across the ceiling, illuminating every aisle with a consistent brightness. The carts were neatly nested at the entrance. The shopper took a cart and moved toward the produce section. 
        Apples were stacked in even pyramids, misted at regular intervals by a quiet spray system. A sign above them read “Rs. 50/kg”. They picked up a plastic bag, selected four apples of similar size, and placed them inside. Then they proceeded to the bread aisle. Shelves were lined with loaves sorted by brand and type: whole wheat, white, rye, and multigrain. 
        They took one loaf from the middle shelf and placed it in the cart. At the far end of the aisle, another shopper turned the corner pushing a half-full cart. Neither acknowledged the other. Eventually, the shopper moved to the self-checkout area. The machine gave voice instructions in a neutral tone as each item was scanned and bagged. After payment was made, the shopper walked out carrying two filled bags, the doors sliding open again automatically.

The platform surface was clean, with a yellow safety line painted along the edge. The air was still. A few people stood spaced apart, facing the tracks. One person leaned slightly against a pillar, scrolling through a phone.
        Another adjusted their backpack and looked briefly at the timetable. A recorded announcement played through overhead speakers, repeating information about train arrivals and platform safety. Far down the track, a distant rumble signaled an approaching train. The headlights became visible as it rounded a curve. People adjusted their positions slightly, but no one spoke. The train slowed to a stop with a hiss of air brakes, doors aligning exactly with the marked boarding areas.
        The passengers stepped in calmly. As the doors closed, the train pulled away with a soft whine. The platform was still again, and the digital sign reset to show the schedule for the next train.
